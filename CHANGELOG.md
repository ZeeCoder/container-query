# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](http://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/)
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Removed

- `react-container-query`
  - Removed the "render" prop in favour of using children. (The former was not
    even documented.)
  - Removed the `ResizeObserver` component in favour of the
    [react-resize-observer](https://github.com/ZeeCoder/react-resize-observer) and
    [use-resize-observer](https://github.com/ZeeCoder/use-resize-observer) packages.
  - Removed the default export. (Both ContainerQuery and withContainerQuery is
    still available as named exports.)
  - Removed the `stats` prop from ContainerQuery. (Use `meta` instead.)

## [3.0.0-alpha.1]

### Fixed

- Tests now check if custom props are properly set
- Change sets are tested with hyphenated prop names instead of camel cased ones

## [3.0.0-alpha.0]

### Added

- Testing in Node 10

### Removed

- "test" script is now only in the root, instead of in every package.
- [BREAKING] No longer testing for Node 7

### Changed

- `container-query-meta-builder`

  - Removed the engines field package.json field
  - [BREAKING] Removed the UMD build

- `postcss-container-query`
  - [BREAKING] Minimum Node version lifted to v8
  - [BREAKING] Dropped the `getJSON` option, and no json is saved by default.
    The new behaviour is to use the ICSS `:export` syntax, which then can be
    imported through css-loader. (The meta object is still passed down in the
    postcss plugin messages in case it's needed.)

## [2.4.1]

## [2.4.0]

### Added

- `react-container-query`
  - New `ContainerQuery` and `ResizeObserver` components

## [2.3.1]

### Fixed

- `container-query`
  - `Node.forEach` is no longer globally polyfilled. (using a simple for loop
    instead internally)

## [2.3.0]

### Fixed

- Containers can now be safely nested. (Container Boundaries)

## [2.2.1]

### Fixed

- postcss-container-query default `getJSON` function now only overwrites a
  previous file if there's an actual change.

## [2.2.0]

### Added

- react-container-query module
- doc updates
- various refactorings

## [2.1.0]

### Added

- [size-limit](https://github.com/ai/size-limit) for limiting bundle sizes

### Changed

- Dependency updates

### Fixed

- Missing `NodeList.forEach` #72

## [2.0.0] - 2017-09-04

### Added

- New diffing algorithm, which keeps track of the container's status (which
  query was applied already) and applies / removes the least amount of new styles
  possible.
- r-units produce a value with limited precision. This is 2 by default, which
  can be changed in the Container options as `valuePrecision`.
- `singleContainer` option (true by default), which makes the use of
  `@define-container` unnecessary for single-file containers. (Works well with
  Component-based architecture.)
- Support for using r-units with css custom props. ie: `--rw: 1rw;`

### Changed

- Published the runtime and the postcss plugin separately, both of which reside
  in the same monorepo. (Thanks to [Lerna](https://github.com/lerna/lerna))
- Container instances are auto-adjusting themselves on size change by default.
  (`adjustOnResize` option.)
- Bundling with Rollup instead of just transpiling the source. This gives better
  control over what is exposed, makes it easy to support other module formats in
  the future, and integrates Babel seemlessly.

### Removed

- Removed support for the container and css unit combinations - like chpx - in
  favour of rw/rh/rmin/rmax units.
- Removed `initialiseAllContainers`. It'll be turned to a demo instead in the
  future.
- Removed some of the limitation on r-units. Paddings, for example can now use
  them.

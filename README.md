A PostCSS plugin and Javascript runtime combination, which allows you to write
**container queries** in your CSS the same way you would write **media queries**.

## Introduction

Container queries work the same way media queries do: they allow you to apply
styles to elements when certain conditions are met.

While media queries are relative to the viewport's size, container queries are
relative to a container element's size.

**What is a Container?**

A container is just an HTML element, which may contain other elements.

You may want to think of them as "**Components**" ([React](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/components-and-props.html))
or "**Blocks**" ([BEM](http://getbem.com/naming/)).

## Highlights

- Built with webpack / React in mind, but can be used with legacy projects too.
- Uses a [ResizeObserver polyfill](https://github.com/que-etc/resize-observer-polyfill)
  to detect size changes. If you use Chrome, you can test how performant the plugin
  is with the native `ResizeObserver` (shipped in 64): https://codesandbox.io/s/l3rmm1rz2l
- Intuitive media query like syntax: `@container (...) { /* ... */ }`
- Supports container units: rh, rw, rmin, rmax. (Useful to set font-size
  and other properties to a value that's changing with the container's size.)
- Diffing algorithm which applies / removes only the necessary styles when a
  change occurs.

## Look and feel

```pcss
// User.pcss
.User {
  background: red;

  @container (width >= 200px) and (height >= 200px) {
    background: green;
  }

  &__name {
    font-size: 10rh;
  }

  &__avatar {
    display: none;

    @container (width >= 200px) and (height >= 200px) {
      display: block;
    }
  }
}
```

The above example assumes **webpack**, using **BEM** naming conventions and the
**postcss-loader**.

`.User` is automatically detected to be the container (the first class in the
proccessed file), and all following container queries / units will be related
to the containing `.User` element.

The html then could look like this:

```html
<div class="User">
  <div class="User__name"></div>
  <img class="User__avatar" src="..." />
</div>
```

Finally, after you create a new `Container` instance, (passing in the container
HTMLElement, and the extracted metadata) everything will just work.

_Note:_ A file can have multiple containers, with the [@define-container](docs/multiple-containers.md)
declaration, but it's encouraged to have a dedicated file for each component.
(Which is also the assumption of the [@zeecoder/react-container-query](https://github.com/ZeeCoder/container-query/tree/master/packages/react-container-query) package).

## Documentation

- [Getting Started](docs/getting-started.md)
- [Usage with webpack and React](docs/webpack-and-react.md)
- [Usage with Gulp](docs/gulp.md)
- [Multiple Containers](docs/multiple-containers.md)
- [Usage without webpack](docs/without-webpack.md)
- [Syntax](docs/syntax.md)
- [API](docs/api.md)
- [Usage with CSS Preprocessors](docs/css-preprocessors.md)

## Demos

Note that because these demos are hosted on [CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io)
where webpack cannot be configured, styles are simply imported as strings and
processed in the browser. (using [@zeecoder/cq-demo-utils](https://github.com/ZeeCoder/cq-demo-utils))

While this works for the demos, in a real application it is strongly recommended
to process styles build-time.

- [Social Posts](https://codesandbox.io/s/0l71yp80w)
- [Without React](https://codesandbox.io/s/mo7nr90vmj)

## Browser Support

Works with all modern browsers and IE10+

## Caveats / Notes

- The ResizeObserver polyfill reacts in ~20ms. For the most part that should be ok, but
  if you need more control over when a container applies new styles, however, you
  can switch off the observing behaviour, and call the `adjust` method on the
  Container instance manually, when you see fit.
  Due to this 20ms reaction time, the more you nest containers, the slower change
  propagates from top to bottom. (**This is a no longer an issue** if the native
  `ResizeObserver` is available, for example in Chrome 64 and up.)
- Styles are applied with the `Element.style.setProperty` method by default.
  This logic will probably be configurable in the future (#50) which will allow for
  different approaches. (Using [Styletron](https://github.com/rtsao/styletron), for
  instance.)
- With element / container query solutions, circularity issues may arise. While
  [an attempt](https://github.com/ZeeCoder/container-query/issues/20) to tackle
  this was made, the same is still unfortunately true to this library as well.
  Use your best judgement when setting up container queries / units to avoid these
  issues.

## Thoughts on design

In case you're wondering about the tool's design, here is a list of goals I
had in mind when I started:

- Should be tested,
- Should use containers instead of elements,
- Should use a media query-like syntax so that it's familiar and easy to use,
- Should be easy enough to use, but a transpiling step would be assumed,
- Should uses PostCSS for preprocessing, instead of having a runtime parser,
- Should use JS modules, so it plays nicely with bundlers (webpack, Browserify,
  etc.) and Component-oriented UI libraries (React, Vue, etc.),
- Shouldn't be limited to CSS syntax. (Utilising custom at-rules for instance),
- Should work with component naming methodologies - like BEM or SUIT - the best.

## Alternatives

If you like the idea of container queries, but are not particularly
convinced by this solution, then I encourage you to look at these alternatives:

- [EQCSS](https://github.com/eqcss/eqcss)
- [CQ Prolyfill](https://github.com/ausi/cq-prolyfill)
- [React Container Query](https://github.com/d6u/react-container-query)
- [CSS Element Queries](https://github.com/marcj/css-element-queries)

## WICG

We at the WICG dived into 2018 with renewed effort to make native
Container Queries a reality in browsers.

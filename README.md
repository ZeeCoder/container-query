A PostCSS plugin and Javascript runtime combination, which allows you to write
**container queries** in your CSS the same way you would write **media queries**.

ðŸ•¶ **Resize Observer**: Uses the native ResizeObserver implentation when available,
and falls back to a [polyfill](https://github.com/que-etc/resize-observer-polyfill)
to detect size changes. If you use Chrome, [you can test](https://codesandbox.io/s/l3rmm1rz2l)
how performant the plugin is with the native implementation. (Shipped in v64.)

ðŸ“¦ **Bundler Support**: Built with bundlers in mind, like [Parcel](https://parceljs.org),
[webpack](https://webpack.js.org), [Browserify](http://browserify.org/) among others.

ðŸŽ² **Component Support**: Built with component-based libraries in mind, like
[React](https://reactjs.org), [Vue](https://vuejs.org/), [Ember](https://emberjs.com/),
[Angular](https://angularjs.org/) among others.

ðŸ“„ **Intuitive syntax**: Uses at-rules, the same way @media queries are:
`@container (...) { ... }`

ðŸŽ‰ **Container Units**: [rh, rw, rmin, rmax,](docs/syntax.md#Units) which are
relative to the container element's width and / or height. (Same way viewport
units are relative to the viewport's size.)

## Introduction

Container queries are very similar to media queries; they allow you to apply
styles to elements when certain conditions are met.

The key difference is that while media queries are relative to the viewport's
size, container queries are relative to a container element's size.

Thanks to this trait, you can have multiple instances of the same container
element, all of which changes its own- and its childrens' styles based on the
containing element's size.

**What is a Container?**

A container is just an HTML element, which may (or may not) contain other elements.

You may want to think of them as "**Components**" ([React](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/components-and-props.html))
or "**Blocks**" ([BEM](http://getbem.com/naming/)).

## Demos

The best way to understand the concept, if you play around with it yourself.

- [Nested components](https://codesandbox.io/s/k9n28rkkl7)
- [Social Posts](https://codesandbox.io/s/0l71yp80w)
- [Without React](https://codesandbox.io/s/mo7nr90vmj)

Note that because these demos are hosted on [CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io)
where webpack or PostCSS cannot (currently) be configured, styles are simply
imported as strings and processed in the browser.
(Using [@zeecoder/cq-demo-utils](https://github.com/ZeeCoder/cq-demo-utils).)

While this works demo purposes, in a real application it is strongly recommended
to process styles build-time, as later described in this documentation.

## Look and Feel

// todo remove once everything here is covered by other sections

```pcss
// User.pcss
.User {
  background: red;

  @container (width >= 200px) and (height >= 200px) {
    background: green;
  }

  &__name {
    font-size: 10rh;
  }

  &__avatar {
    display: none;

    @container (width >= 200px) and (height >= 200px) {
      display: block;
    }
  }
}
```

The above example assumes **webpack**, using **BEM** naming conventions and the
**postcss-loader**.

`.User` is automatically detected to be the container (the first class in the
proccessed file), and all following container queries / units will be related
to the containing `.User` element.

The html then could look like this:

```html
<div class="User">
  <div class="User__name"></div>
  <img class="User__avatar" src="..." />
</div>
```

(Note that for container queries and units to work, all elements must be
descendants of the container, as their conditions and values only makes sense in
a container's context.)

Finally, after you create a new `Container` instance, (passing in the container
HTMLElement, and the extracted metadata) everything will just work.

_Note:_ A file can have multiple containers, with the [@define-container](docs/multiple-containers.md)
declaration, but it's encouraged to have a dedicated file for each component.
(Which is also the assumption of the [@zeecoder/react-container-query](https://github.com/ZeeCoder/container-query/tree/master/packages/react-container-query) package).

## Thoughts on Design

In case you're wondering about the tool's design, here is a list of goals I had
in mind when I started:

- Should be tested,
- Should use containers instead of elements (As opposed to other "element-query"
  libraries.),
- Should use a media query-like syntax so that it's familiar and easy to use,
- Should uses PostCSS for preprocessing, instead of having a runtime parser,
- Should be easy enough to use, but a transpiling step would be assumed (Due to
  the reason above.),
- Should use ES modules, so it plays nicely with bundlers (Parcel, webpack
  Browserify, etc.) and with Component-oriented UI libraries (React, Vue, etc.),
- Should work best with component naming methodologies, like BEM or SUIT, but
  should also work without them.
- Should work with CSS Modules.
